## 🛠️ League of Legends Skins 🛠️

✨ Welcome to my personal collection of League of Legends skins! 💅 I'll be uploading skins gradually as I continue uploading and organizing them. 📁 Explore, use, and modify the assets as you wish, keeping in mind the guidelines of usage. 🏆

## 🌈 Features 🌈

* **Expanding Collection:** This archive will grow as more skins are extracted and uploaded over time. 📈
* **Organized by Champion/Themes:** Skins are categorized by champion or skin lines for easy navigation. 🔍
* **Custom Skins:** I will also add custom skins I find, with proper credits to the creators, as I enjoy some custom skins too. ✨

## 🚀 Getting Started 🚀

To use the skins, simply download the files and follow the instructions below:

1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ahtisham2268/lol-skins.git
    ```
2. Browse through the folders to find the skins you're interested in. 🔍
3. **Recommended Tool:** Use **CSLol-Manager** to easily install and manage the skins in your game. You can find it [here](https://github.com/LeagueToolkit/cslol-manager) for more details and installation instructions. 🔧

## 🧰 Tools 🧰

In addition to skins, I will also upload various League-related tools to this repository. One such tool is:

### [League Profile Customization Tool](https://github.com/MManoah/league-profile-tool)
This application shows how data sent to the LCU can be modified or read to change visual aspects like icons, backgrounds, and hovercards, or read data such as profile data, friends, and more. *Note: This tool is created by MManoah and is shared from GitHub; it is not my own work.* 🛠️
